# Sparse

- It's a library for creating parsers from smaller units and their composition;
- It's an implementation of a concept I had in mind, **not production ready**;
- The API shouldn't be considered stable, as I'm not sure of it;
- Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/jlucasnsilva/sparse/tree/main/examples).
